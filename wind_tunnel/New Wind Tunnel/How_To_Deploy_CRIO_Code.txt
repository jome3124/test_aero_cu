This document describes the steps to deploy code to the CRIO.   This procedure must be followed otherwise
there appears to be errors in establishing the network stream connection running the code any other way
outside of the project.

In the project explorer window, right click on Build Specifications
	Select New < Source Distribution
	Under the Information Category, choose a Build specification name.  This doesn't really matter
	Go to Source Files.  Move at least the main file that needs to be run into the Always Included
		section.  Moving more files in here that are run won't hurt anything.
	To be safe, go to the Additional Exclusions Category and make sure that the following are unchecked.
		Exclude files from vi.lib
		Exclude files from instr.lib
		Exclude files from user.lib

	You can now select Build at the bottom.

Right click on your newly created source distribution under the Build Specifications tab on the project.
	Select Deploy.  (Make sure you are connected to the CRIO)

If you left all of the default settings, the new code should be deployed under C:\ni-rt\startup\MainVi.vi
The following website outlines how to start that code, as well as this general process.

The version of the Wind Tunnel code as of 12/20/19 had a working version of the CPU vi that successfully
called the code on the CRIO to run and was able to connect.  If necessary, revert the code back to this
version to see how it was working then.
